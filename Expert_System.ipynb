        "# Task\n",
        "The user wants to implement backward chaining in the provided HVAC expert system using the `experta` library. This involves defining a `GoalFact` to represent a query, creating rules that identify missing information needed to prove that goal, prompting the user for this information via an `AskFact` mechanism, and finally, proving or failing the goal based on the collected facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the plan to achieve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define `GoalFact` and `AskFact`**: Introduce two new `Fact` types:\n",
        "    *   `GoalFact`: Represents a diagnosis the system is trying to prove, with a `query` string and a `status` (pending, satisfied, or failed).\n",
        "    *   `AskFact`: Represents a prompt to the user for a specific `attribute`, including the `prompt` message and the `value_type` expected for the input.\n",
        "2.  **Implement `ask_user_for_fact` Rule**: Create a high-salience rule (`ask_user_for_fact`) that matches any `AskFact`, uses `input()` to get information from the user, declares a new `HVACFact` with the collected data, and then retracts the `AskFact`. It also handles invalid input by re-prompting.\n",
        "3.  **Create Goal-Driven Rules for Specific Diagnoses**: For each diagnosis where backward chaining is desired (e.g., 'Heat & Vibration Fault', 'Low Refrigerant Charge', 'Fan Motor / Blower Issue'), define a set of rules:\n",
        "    *   **Requesting Rules**: Rules with higher salience that match a `GoalFact` for a specific query. These rules will check if a necessary `HVACFact` (like `temperature` or `vibration`) is missing (`NOT(HVACFact(attribute=W()))`) and if an `AskFact` for that attribute is not already pending. If both conditions are true, they declare an `AskFact` to gather the missing information. These rules chain, so if `temperature` is needed and not present, it's asked first. Once `temperature` is known, if `vibration` is needed and not present, it's asked.\n",
        "    *   **Proving Rule**: A rule with lower salience that fires once all necessary `HVACFact`s are present *and* meet the conditions required for the diagnosis. This rule retracts the pending `GoalFact`, declares it as `satisfied`, and also declares the standard `Fact(diagnosis=...)` and `Fact(action=...)`.\n",
        "4.  **Modify Main Execution (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**:\n",
        "    *   Add new test cases that declare a `GoalFact` for a specific diagnosis (e.g., `engine.declare(GoalFact(query='Heat & Vibration Fault'))`).\n",
        "    *   Run the engine. The system will then work backward, prompting the user for facts until the goal is proven or no more rules can fire.\n",
        "    *   After `engine.run()`, iterate through the engine's facts to report the final `status` of the queried `GoalFact`. A `pending` status after the engine stops running indicates the goal could not be proven.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach simulates backward chaining in Experta by using rules to proactively request facts that are missing prerequisites for a declared goal.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`GoalFact` and `AskFact` Definition**: We introduced two new `Fact` types:\n",
        "    *   `GoalFact`: Represents a query the system aims to prove, with fields for `query` (the diagnosis name) and `status` ('pending', 'satisfied', 'failed').\n",

        "\n",
        "2.  **`ask_user_for_fact` Rule**: A high-salience rule (`salience=100`) was implemented to process `AskFact`s. When an `AskFact` is declared, this rule fires, prompts the user for input, validates it against the specified `value_type`, declares a new `HVACFact` with the collected information, and retracts the `AskFact`. This ensures that user inquiries are handled immediately and effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Goal-Driven Requesting Rules**: For the 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' goal, three requesting rules were added with high salience (30, 29, 28) to prioritize gathering necessary facts:\n",
        "    *   `request_filter_for_poor_maintenance_goal`: Asks for `filter_status` if it's missing and not already being asked.\n",
        "    *   `request_airflow_for_poor_maintenance_goal`: Asks for `airflow` if `filter_status` is present, `airflow` is missing, and not already being asked.\n",
        "    *   `request_noise_for_poor_maintenance_goal`: Asks for `noise` if both `filter_status` and `airflow` are present, `noise` is missing, and not already being asked.\n",
        "    These rules work in sequence, ensuring that the system intelligently requests information only when necessary for the current goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Goal Proving Rule**: The `prove_poor_maintenance_goal` rule (with `salience=10`) was implemented. This rule fires when all conditions for 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' (`filter_status='dirty'`, `airflow='low'`, `noise='unusual'`) are met *and* the `GoalFact` for this diagnosis is still 'pending'. Upon firing, it retracts the pending `GoalFact`, declares a new `GoalFact` with `status='satisfied'`, and also declares the standard `Fact(diagnosis=...)` and `Fact(action=...)` for output.\n",

        "*   **Backward Chaining Test 1 (Heat & Vibration Fault)**: The system correctly identified the missing `temperature` and `vibration` facts, prompted the user, and then satisfied the goal once valid inputs were provided. The output indicated the goal was `SATISFIED`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Backward Chaining Test 5 (Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues)**: This new test case specifically targets the 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' goal. The system successfully initiated backward chaining, prompting the user for `filter_status`, `airflow`, and `noise` in sequence. When the user provides inputs that match the conditions (e.g., 'dirty' filter, 'low' airflow, 'unusual' noise), the `prove_poor_maintenance_goal` rule fires, and the goal is declared `SATISFIED`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Backward Chaining Test (Failed Goal)**: A test case was included where user input did not meet the conditions for a specific goal (e.g., 'Heat & Vibration Fault' with normal vibration). The system correctly failed to prove the goal, reporting `FAILED`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Forward Chaining (Clogged Air Filter)**: The system retains its forward-chaining capabilities. When initial facts (e.g., `filter_status='dirty'` and `airflow='low'`) are declared without an explicit `GoalFact`, the relevant forward-chaining rule fires, and a diagnosis is made. The `check_goal_status` function confirms that no `GoalFact` was explicitly declared or satisfied for 'Clogged Air Filter', as expected in a purely forward-chaining scenario.\n",

        "### Discussion:\n",
        "\n",
        "The integration of `GoalFact` and `AskFact` with strategically salienced rules effectively simulates backward chaining within Experta's forward-chaining engine. The system starts with a desired conclusion (the `GoalFact`) and works backward by identifying missing premises and actively requesting them from the user. This interactive process allows the expert system to dynamically gather the necessary information to reach a diagnosis, rather than passively waiting for all facts to be presented upfront. The `salience` attribute is crucial in controlling the order of rule firing, ensuring that `AskFact`s are handled promptly and requesting rules trigger before proving rules. The `check_goal_status` helper function effectively reports the outcome of goal-driven inquiries, providing clarity on whether a specific diagnosis was proven or not."

        "### Q&A\n",
        "1.  **Summarize the implementation of backward chaining within the Experta framework:**\n",
        "    Backward chaining was implemented by introducing `GoalFact` and `AskFact` facts. `GoalFact` represents a diagnosis query with a `status` (pending, satisfied, failed), while `AskFact` facilitates user interaction by storing needed `attribute`, `prompt`, and `value_type`. A high-salience `ask_user_for_fact` rule handles `AskFact`s, prompting the user, validating input, declaring `HVACFact`s, and retracting the `AskFact`. Goal-driven requesting rules, also with high salience, check for missing facts required by a pending `GoalFact` and declare `AskFact`s. Finally, a goal-proving rule, with lower salience, fires when all conditions for a `GoalFact` are met, marking the goal as 'satisfied'. This architecture effectively leverages Experta's forward-chaining mechanism to simulate goal-driven backward chaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Explain how backward chaining works within the Experta framework:**\n",
        "    In Experta, backward chaining is simulated using a forward-chaining engine augmented with goal-oriented facts and rule salience. When a `GoalFact` (e.g., 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues') is declared as 'pending', rules specifically designed for this goal's prerequisites become active. These rules check if necessary facts (like `filter_status`, `airflow`, `noise`) are missing. If a fact is missing, a rule with high `salience` declares an `AskFact`. The general `ask_user_for_fact` rule, having the highest `salience` (100), then immediately fires, pauses the inference process, queries the user, and declares the new fact. Once all prerequisite facts for a goal are present, the goal's proving rule, with a specific `salience` (e.g., 10), fires, satisfying the `GoalFact` and declaring the diagnosis. This flow ensures that the system proactively gathers information needed to prove a specific goal, mimicking a backward-chaining strategy within a forward-chaining inference cycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Discuss the results from the new test case:**\n",
        "    The new test case for 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' successfully demonstrated the backward chaining mechanism. The system initially lacked the required `filter_status`, `airflow`, and `noise` facts. Upon declaring `GoalFact(query='Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues')`, the system sequentially prompted the user for these three facts: first `filter_status`, then `airflow`, and finally `noise`, in the order determined by the salience of the requesting rules. Once the user provided the specific inputs ('dirty', 'low', 'unusual'), the `prove_poor_maintenance_goal` rule fired, resulting in the `GoalFact` for 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' being `SATISFIED` and the corresponding diagnosis and action being declared. This validates that the new rules effectively guide the system to obtain necessary information and reach the target diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The HVAC expert system now effectively combines forward and backward chaining, allowing it to proactively seek information for specific diagnostic goals.\n",
        "*   For the 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' goal, the system successfully requested three missing facts (`filter_status`, `airflow`, `noise`) from the user, demonstrating a goal-driven inquiry process.\n",
        "*   The `ask_user_for_fact` rule (salience 100) ensures immediate processing of user input requests, with validation against specified value types.\n",
        "*   The new `prove_poor_maintenance_goal` rule correctly identified and satisfied the 'Poor Maintenance / Multiple Issues' diagnosis when inputs were 'dirty' filter, 'low' airflow, and 'unusual' noise.\n",
        "*   The system correctly handles cases where user input does not meet diagnostic criteria, failing to satisfy the goal as demonstrated in the 'Heat & Vibration Fault' test with non-matching inputs.\n",
        "*   The hybrid approach ensures that existing forward-chaining rules (e.g., for 'Clogged Air Filter') remain functional even when no explicit goal is set, providing comprehensive diagnostic capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The use of `salience` in Experta is critical for orchestrating hybrid inference strategies, prioritizing user interaction and goal-driven data collection over passive rule firing.\n",
        "*   Consider expanding the `AskFact` and `ask_user_for_fact` rule to support more complex input types (e.g., multiple-choice questions) or provide more robust error messages and guidance to the user.\n"
